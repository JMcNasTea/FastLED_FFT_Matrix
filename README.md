# FastLED_FFT_Matrix
WS2812B LED matrix with an Arduino Nano ESP32. Input taken from a 3.5mm aux, processed by FFT and displayed on the matrix with FastLED. Frankenstein-ed the code together with many different code snippets and had to tweak it to work with two LED strips since I messed up my wiring (oops). Ideally you could work with one LED strip.
